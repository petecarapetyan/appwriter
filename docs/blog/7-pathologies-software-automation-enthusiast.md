# 7 Pathologies of a Software Automation Enthusiast

        This was written in 2015, seems to have held true

### Tail Wags Dog

Tends to believe that all things in software development can be automated, regardless of evidence to the contrary.

### ISOMORPHISM

Obsessed with teasing out the common elements to every two or more tasks, refactoring the code to automate the common elements.

### TOOLING OVER LANGUAGE

Regards the maturity of tooling as dramatically more helpful than the sexiness of a language. Refactoring capabilities, IDEs, typeAhead tend to dominate all discussions where language is involved.

### FEEDBACK SPEED

Will do almost anything to maintain a fast-fail environment. Even Continuous Delivery, unit testing, keystroke/muscleMemory, no measure is beyond considering to maintain immediate feedback.

### PARANOID of SIZE

Imagines enemies in every form of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_ball_of_mud">Big Ball of Mud Pattern</a>. Willing to experiment with OSGi, linux containers, SOA, microservices, refactoring, just about anything to avoid binary hell or digging through log files for days to find a buried malfunction.

### METRICS, TIMING, DRILLS

Can often quote how many seconds, minutes, or hours any given task takes with a specific maturity level. Prone to extrapolating budgets based on projected numbers, running drills to time against expectations, other foolish time-wasters.

### TIME IN THE WILDERNESS

Strangely comfortable with a history of many failures, often in many disciplines, even outside of software development. Seems to lack common sense that would keep him/her out of trouble with others. May or may not live with handicaps such as Asbergers, a MeyersBriggs INTJ score, or other disabling conditions.

      
There is a cute vignette of this pathological archetype in the famous book &quot;The Phoenix Project&quot;, in many different, colorful charachters.

Why be normal? You wouldn't ask me, I have no frame of reference to go by.
